You may use the installed python but you will need to install SciPy. There are a few ways to do this, but grabbing an installer from this site http://trichech.us/?page_id=5 seems easiest. On my installation I got a fortran error which I solved by installing from this page (http://hpc.sourceforge.net/) this link (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hpc/gfortran-intel-leopard-bin.tar.gz?download) and may be installed with this command  "sudo tar -xvf gfortran-intel-leopard-bin.tar.gz -C /" or "sudo tar -xvf gfortran-intel-leopard-bin.tar -C /" if it is unzipped upon download. Everything should be fine and running.

= Intel Mac 10.4 Tiger =

You will need to install python 2.5. You may get it here (http://www.activestate.com/store/activepython/download/). The SciPy installer is no longer supported but can be found here (http://idisk.mac.com/fonnesbeck-Public/ScipySuperpack-Intel-10.4-py2.5). Install issues are unknown at this time after the installation of these two items. (Requires a brand of python called ActivePython which is free)
